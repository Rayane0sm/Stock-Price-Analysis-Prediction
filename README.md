# Stock Price Analysis & Prediction

Using historical natural gas price data, this project applied time series analysis and linear regression to study price fluctuations. Data was explored through statistical tests (ADF test for stationarity), moving averages, and visualizations such as line plots and boxplots. Predictive models were built with regression to estimate future price movements, evaluating performance with metrics like MSE, MAE, and RÂ². This TP highlighted data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and forecasting techniques in financial data
